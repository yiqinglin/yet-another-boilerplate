Just another boilerplate for React/GraphQL/Node/MongoDB project.

## Notes

### GraphQL

GraphQL Playground is available at localhost:8080/graphql

### Flow

Flow is used for client-side typing. Install `flow-bin` globally and run `flow` to monitor the code change.

### ESLint/Prettier

ESLint lints the code and Prettier formats it.
With `ESLint` and `Prettier` extensions in VSCode, the editor shows if the code contains any linting error/warning and it is automatically formatted on save.
